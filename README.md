Python program on PyCharm using anaconda and tensorflow 2.0. Takes in an input of 28 x 28 greyscale pixels of clothings. The input layer is one neuron which is an array compressed to 728 pixels (28x28), the hidden layer has 128 neurons (picked arbitrarily), and the output layer has 10 neurons for each type of clothing. The output neuron with the highest probability (0->1) will be selected, and the accuracy after the model was trained and tested was over 85%.
